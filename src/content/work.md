**As a front-end architect with 25 years of experience, I’ve delivered high-impact web solutions for global brands—blending technical precision with user-focused innovation. I remain hands-on with code, continuously exploring new tools and techniques.**

At **Volvo Cars**, I led two dev teams, building Next.js applications and React Server Components to streamline financing and pricing displays across global markets, cutting Time to First Byte by 30%. My team earned the **Volvo Quality Award** (2021) for enhancing customer satisfaction.

For **Riot Games**, I developed a web developer interview assignment, designed to test both coding skills and design thinking. At **AKQA**, I led global web best practices, launching **TECH.insight meetups**, and built solutions for **Nike**, including the _Nike+ JavaScript SDK_ and _Wall of Phenomenal_ dual-screen experience for soccer tournaments. I also refactored 5,000 lines of JavaScript for **Nokia Ovi Maps**.

Specializing in **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **accessibility**, and **performance optimization**, I work closely with cross-functional teams to deliver inclusive, scalable systems that stand the test of time—**and I still write code every day** to stay sharp and build better solutions.
